The trilogy is known for its stylish and violent action scenes, as well as its use of Mexican culture and music.
 
El Mariachi was made by Robert Rodriguez with a budget of only $7,000, which he raised by participating in medical experiments. He shot the film in Mexico with a mostly amateur cast and crew, using borrowed equipment and improvised props. He edited the film on a VCR and submitted it to film festivals, where it won several awards and attracted the attention of Hollywood studios. The film was later distributed by Columbia Pictures and became a cult hit.
 
El Mariachi has been praised by critics and audiences for its originality, creativity, and energy. It has been recognized as one of the best independent films of all time, as well as one of the best action films of all time. It has also influenced many other filmmakers, such as Quentin Tarantino, who cast Rodriguez as a guest director in his film Grindhouse (2007).
